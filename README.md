## Attention Is All You Need
https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
This method claims to do away with the need for RNNs and CNNs, introducing (or using) methods of "Positional Encoding", and "Multi-Head Attention" (and Masked Multi-Head Attention) mechanisms in their model.

## Video Frame Interpolation via Adaptive Separable Convolution
https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01692
This model creates interpolated frames between lower frame-rate video input. However, instead of the more usual direct output of the frames, it generates a set of image processing kernels for each pair of inputs -- the kernels operate on the input image pair, producing the final interpolated frame.
